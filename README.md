## Language Support

This plugin currently implements Syntax highlighting for the full Beancount v2 syntax. If you encounter any problems, please report an issue.

Autocompletion support is pretty rudimentary at the moment. Tags and links can be completed and accounts can be completed in transactions but not elsewhere.
